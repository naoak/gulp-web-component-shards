gulp-web-component-shards [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Collaborne/gulp-web-component-shards.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Collaborne/gulp-web-component-shards)
=========
Plugin for gulp to process endpoints using [web-component-shards](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/web-component-shards).

## Installation

	$ npm install --save-dev gulp-web-component-shards

## Usage

```js
var wcs = require('gulp-web-component-shards');

gulp.task('shards', function() {
    gulp.src('app/elements/*.html', { base: 'app', read: false })
        .pipe(wcs({
		root: 'app',
		shared: 'shared.html',
		bower_components: 'bower_components',
		work: '.tmp/web-component-shards'
	}))
	.pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));
});
```

The plugin will process the given sources as endpoints, and return their vulcanized
forms. Note that the sources must exist properly on the file system, the plugin only
considers the file names.

### Options

- `root`: The root directory of the application, paths in imports are assumed to be relative to that. Defaults to the current directory.
- `shared`: The (relative-to-root) path for the shared import file, defaults to `shared.html`
- `threshold`: The sharing threshold.
- `bower_components`: The bower_components directory, relative to `root`. Defaults to `bower_components`.
- `work`: A work directory for the plugin, defaults to `.tmp/web-component-shards`.
